# YtFlowTunnel
The core component handling VPN traffic and lifecycle

**Going forward, YtFlowTunnel will be superseded by [YtFlowCore](https://github.com/YtFlow/YtFlowCore), which is more powerful, portable, and performant and will become the new core component. YtFlowTunnel is not used or maintained any more.**
